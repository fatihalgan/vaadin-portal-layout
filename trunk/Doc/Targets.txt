Targets:

- Portal-style layout with sufficient performance.
- Most of the functionality implemented on the client side.

- Support of the portlets as the content blocks.
- Portlet is somewhat a panel that can expand, collapse and close.
- Portlets can be rendered in the columns of the portal.
- Think about maintaining the border regions where the portlets might be laid out.

- Should be able to add any kind of component, but they all automatically being wrapped into the portlets.

- Support of the column widths control via splitters.
- Support of the portlet height control inside the column.

- Support for the binding the of the column width to the width of any of its portlets, so whatever other portlet is 
  contained in column it would be forced to fit the width of the chosen one.  

- Freezing portlets, so no DnD available for them.

- DnD between the columns support.
  * Ability to pin the portlet so it can't be neither popped by any other widget nor dragged itself.
  * Rendering the outline of the current drop location of the portlet.
  
- Column collapsing support.
- Column closing support.
