Portal functionality overview.

Three frameworks that have portal functionality were considered: EXT-GWT (Sencha), ZK, SmartGWT. All three have similar principles. 
- Portal is panel divided into columns with portlets inside. 
- Portlets are mere layout containers that can embed whatever content. 
- Portlets are laid out in columns without gaps. 
- Portlets support collapsing and closing.
- Portal support DnD of portlets between columns.
- The columns might be empty.

EXT-GWT.

- Portlet is a ContentPanel.
- The width of the portal is evenly divided between the columns.

ZK.

- Columns might have the different width. All the portlets are sized so they fit into it.

SmartGWT.

- The width of the portal is divided evenly between the portlets. 
- Portlets can be dragged into the portal from outside.
