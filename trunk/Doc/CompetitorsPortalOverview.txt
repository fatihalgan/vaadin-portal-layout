Portal functionality overview.

Three frameworks that have portal functionality were considered: EXT-GWT (Sencha), ZK, SmartGWT. All three have similar principles. 
- Portal is panel divided into columns with portlets inside. 
- Portlets are mere layout containers that can embed whatever content. 
- Portlets are laid out in columns without gaps. 
- Portlets support collapsing and closing.
- Portal support DnD of portlets between columns.
- Dummy (outline) object is shown while the dragging is performed.
- The columns might be empty.

EXT-GWT.

- Portlet is a ContentPanel.
- The width of the portal is evenly divided between the columns.
- Supports pinning the portlets which controls DnD ability.

ZK.

- Columns might have different widths. All the portlets are sized so they fit the column width.

SmartGWT.

- The width of the portal can be adjusted with splitters. 
- Portlets can be dragged into the portal from outside.
- The set of the portlets fills the whole space of the column.
- Portlets in the same column can fill different amount of space.
